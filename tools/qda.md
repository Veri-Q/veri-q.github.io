In *QDA (Design Automation for Quantum Computing)* project in *VeriQ*, a series of QDA tools are developed, including a fault simulator based on tensor network and BDD, an ATPG (Automatic Test Pattern Generation) algorithm based on stabilizer projector decomposition, and a tensor network based decision diagram for representation of tensor networks and quantum circuits. These tools have a wide range of applications such as simulation, verification, synthesis, circuit testing and equivalence checking.
## Fault Simulator
A fault simulation tool for noisy quantum circuits based on tensor network and BDD(binary decision diagram) method.

## ATPG (Automatic Test Pattern Generation)
An automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) algorithm for robust quantum circuit testing based on stabilizer projector decomposition.
